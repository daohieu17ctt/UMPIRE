# UMPIRE: Uncertainty Quantification for Multimodal Large Language Models

**Official repository for the paper: _Uncertainty Quantification for Multimodal Large Language Models_** [[Paper]](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=2UYZHvXUAH)  

**Abstract:** Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise in tackling challenging multimodal tasks, but may generate seemingly plausible but erroneous output, making them hard to trust and deploy in real-life settings. Generating accurate uncertainty metrics quickly for each MLLM response during inference could enable interventions such as escalating queries with uncertain responses to human experts or larger models for improved performance. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods require external verifiers, additional training, or high computational resources, and struggle to handle scenarios such as out-of-distribution (OOD) or adversarial settings. To overcome these limitations, **we present UMPIRE, an efficient and effective training-free framework to estimate MLLM output uncertainty at inference time without external tools**, by computing metrics based on the diversity of the MLLMâ€™s responses that is augmented with internal indicators of each outputâ€™s coherence. We empirically show that our method significantly outperforms benchmarks in predicting incorrect responses and providing calibrated uncertainty estimates, including for OOD, adversarial and domain-specific (e.g., medical radiology) data settings.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daohieu17ctt/UMPIRE.git
cd UMPIRE
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Install dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or with `conda`:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate umpire
```

### 3. Data Preparation

Ensure your datasets (OKVQA, VQAv2, AdvVQA) are placed under the `data/` directory in their respective subfolders. If preprocessing is needed, change the question-answer json file path in this script and run it:

```bash
bash scripts/preprocess_data.sh
```

Please note that this scripts is only used for VQAv2-format dataset, you need to preprocess your own dataset following the format in ```pipeline/vqa_preprocess_data.py```

### 4. Generate Embeddings & Evaluate

```bash
# Step 1: Generate embeddings
bash scripts/generate_and_compute_embedding.sh

# Step 2: Run UMPIRE evaluation
bash scripts/compute_umpire_and_evaluate.sh
```
